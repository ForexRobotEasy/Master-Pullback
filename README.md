## Product Description

Master Pullback is a unique forex expert advisor (EA) developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. It is a fully automated trading system that aims to identify and take advantage of pullback opportunities in the forex market. The EA utilizes a specific set of criteria to determine when a pullback is occurring and opens trades accordingly. 

The main features of the Master Pullback EA include:

- Risk management: The EA allows you to set a risk percentage per trade, which determines the stop loss and take profit levels.
- Automatic trade execution: Once a pullback is identified, the EA opens trades with calculated entry and exit points.
- Trade monitoring: The EA keeps track of open trades and provides information on entry price, exit price, duration, and strength of the pullback.
- Pullback identification: The EA includes functions to determine if pullback conditions are met, calculate the duration and strength of the pullback, and calculate the lot size for each trade.

## Code Explanation

The code is divided into several sections, each serving a specific purpose. Here is a brief explanation of each section:

1. Libraries and Variables: This section includes the necessary libraries and defines the variables used in the code. The `Trade` library is used for trade execution, and the `ArrayObj` library is used to store open trades.
2. Initialization: The `OnInit` function is called during the expert initialization. It calculates the stop loss and take profit levels based on the risk percentage set by the user and prints them for reference.
3. Deinitialization: The `OnDeinit` function is called before the expert is removed from the chart. It closes any open trades to ensure a clean shutdown.
4. Tick Function: The `OnTick` function is called on each tick of the chart. It checks for pullback conditions and opens trades accordingly.
5. Pullback Functions: The `IsPullback`, `GetPullbackDuration`, and `GetPullbackStrength` functions are used to determine if pullback conditions are met and calculate the duration and strength of the pullback.
6. Lot Size Calculation: The `Lots` function is used to calculate the lot size for each trade.

Please refer to the comments in the code for more detailed explanations of each function and section.

## Usage

To use the Master Pullback EA, follow these steps:

1. Install the EA on your MetaTrader 5 platform.
2. Set the desired risk percentage per trade in the `RiskPercentage` input variable.
